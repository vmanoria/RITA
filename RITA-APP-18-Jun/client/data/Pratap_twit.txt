Questions are always a good draw because you can use them to intrigue your followers (“Have you tried this crazy tactic?”) or you can ask followers for their opinion (“Have pictures worked best for you too?”). Either way, people are more likely to click through, retweet or at least tweet you back.
Every blog post has a quotable sentence. If you’re not sure what to add to the tweet, find the sentence that really stands out and use it instead of the article’s title.
Crafting an interesting tweet takes more effort than letting the widget do the work for you (especially if the pre-populated tweet didn’t leave you too many characters to work with). But your followers appreciate the effort. I’m more likely to click a link if I know what to expect, aren’t you?
Taking the time to add the extra information is even more important when you’re sharing your own blog post.
A mistake most people make is tweeting the same headline and link over and over again. That’s not the best way to go about it. People may see your extra tweets, but if you don’t change it up, you look like a spammer (not the image you want, right?).
It’s easy to avoid tweeting out the same thing over and over—just use the tactics outlined in #1 above.
