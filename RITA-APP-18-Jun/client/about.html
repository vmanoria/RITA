            <dt>Benefits of Risk Visualization</dt>
            <ul>
                <li> Single view of customer’s portfolio performance</li>
                <li>Operationalize real-time analytical insights to enable WM/Advisors</li>

                <li>Make more informed asset allocation decisions</li>
                <li>Cognitive learning to leverage on the various data to enable informed decision making</li>

            <dt>Use Cases</dt>

            <ol>
                <li> Identify 3-4 types of representations that influence financial decisions of end customers (depending on the risk profile of the customer)</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Help identify & eliminate risky/weak elements – too much concentration in a particular type of industry</li>
                    <li>Help identify and add new promising ones</li>
                    <li>Help rebalance the amount in existing ones</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Indicate how one could build additional representations very quickly </li>
                <li>Demonstrate superiority of Spotfire in integrating diverse datasets quickly/efficiently </li>
                <li>4. Ability to publish these on different devices and integrate with their features. For instance, if we show a bubble graph of portfolio on an iPAD, can we use touch feature to drill down into a particular product’s performance over time?</li>

            </ol>

            So, can we arrive at 3 representations + variants (filters on the right) for the following cases:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Risk Averse – what kind of representation will force him to rebalance his portfolio?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moderate – what kind of representation will force him to experiment – add a new stock?
                </li>
                <li> Risk Taking – what kind of representation keep him in check – drop some stock?</li>
            </ol>
