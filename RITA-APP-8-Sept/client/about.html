<h3>Benefits of Risk Visualization</h3>
<ul class="benifits">
	<li>Single view of customerâ€™s portfolio performance</li>

    	<ol class="sub-benifit">
        	<li>Help identify & eliminate risky/weak elements â€“ too much concentration in a particular type of industry</li>
            <li>Help identify and add new promising ones</li>
            <li>Help rebalance the amount in existing ones</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Indicate how one could build additional representations very quickly</li>
    <li>Demonstrate superiority of Spotfire in integrating diverse datasets quickly/efficiently</li>
    <li>Ability to publish these on different devices and integrate with their features. For instance, if we show a bubble graph of portfolio on an iPAD, can we use touch feature to drill down into a particular productâ€™s performance over time?</li>
</ol><br>
<br>
<p>So, can we arrive at 3 representations + variants (filters on the right) for the following cases:</p><br>

<ol class="benifits">
	<li>Risk Averse what kind of representation will force him to rebalance his portfolio?</li>
    <li>Moderate what kind of representation will force him to experiment add a new stock?</li>
    <li>Risk Taking what kind of representation keep him in check drop some stock?</li>
</ol>
